                This is a picture of neighbors dog. His name is Schooby and he is part Dachshund and i forgot the the other part. This is a random photo that I have saved in my computer from since last year.
            </td>
            <td><a href="https://torresrl98.github.io/images/boat2.jpg">Hyperrealistic Boat:</a>
               This is one of my favorite photoshopped picture. Its a a hyperrealistic picture. The water gives the picture a real effect but you can see both the background and the man in the boat are both fictions. What makes this one of my favorite pictures is that the old man is with his dog. Probally something I will do when im old and have a dog.

            <td valign="top"><a href="https://torresrl98.github.io/images/wildfire3.jpg">Wildfire:</a>
                This is another photoshopped picture I have made. This was the first picture I have ever photoshopped, it does not look to great. Its a long road with two diffrent side views. One of them is a forest burning and the other is an already burned forest with all the trees dead.
